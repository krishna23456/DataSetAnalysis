Twitter data set analysis for user behaviours and their locations.


The data set is from: https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/display/forward/Dataset-UDI-TwitterCrawl-Aug2012

Three assumptions are analyzed and proved:
1. Locality and num of followers: If there are more followers for a user, the followers will be more distributed.
2. Num of tweets and num of followers: If there are more followers for a user, there will be more tweets created by the user.
3. Users are always tweet from the same data center.
